They gave insight and comprehension of grasping with robot hands but many of them are rather complicated to implement and of high computational complexity. In this paper we study if the basic quality criterion for grasps, the force-closure property, is in principle easy or difficult to reach. We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable. We present statistical data that confirm our opinion that a randomized grasp generation algorithm is fast and suitable for the planning of robot grasping tasks.},

  abstract = {We present an implemented algorithm that accepts a polygonal description of a part's silhouette, and efficiently constructs the set of all feasible fixture designs that kinematically constrain the part in the plane. Each fixture is composed of three locators rigidly attached to the lattice and one sliding clamp, and constrains the part without relying on friction. The algorithm is based on an efficient enumeration of admissible designs that exploits part geometry and graphical force analysis. The algorithm run time is linear in the number of designs found, which is bounded by a polynomial in the number of part edges and the part's maximal diameter in lattice units. Our review of the literature suggests that this is the first fixturing algorithm that is complete in the sense that it is guaranteed to find all admissible fixture designs for an arbitrary polygonal silhouette and to identify the optimal fixture relative to an arbitrary quality metric. The algorithm does not consider out-of-plane forces or motions; however, we view this planar result as an essential component of a larger algorithm that solves the 3D fixture design problem by treating the planar and out-of-plane constraint problems separately. This approach is analogous to the widely used 3-2-1 fixture design heuristic},

  comment   = {When a person picks up a metal part and clamps it in the chuck of a lathe, he begins with his arm, proceeds with his wrist and finishes with his fingers. The arm brings the part near the chuck. The wrist positions the part, giving it the proper orientation to slide in. After the part is inserted, the wrist and fingers make tiny corrections to ensure that it is correctly seated. Today's robot attempting the same operations is at a grave disadvantage if it has to make all motions with the arm. The following work investigates the use of robotic wrists and hands to help industrial robots perform the fine motions needed in a metal working cell. Chapters 1 and 2 are an introduction to the field and a review of previous investigations on related subjects. Little work has been done on grasping and fine manipulation with a robot hand or wrist, but the related subjects of robot arm dynamics and control have an extensive literature.},

In each case we obtain tight bounds on the number of fingers needed to obtain grip. We also present efficient algorithms to synthesize such positive grips for bounded polyhedral/polygonal objects; the number of fingers employed in the grips synthesized by our algorithms match the above bounds.

A grasp on an object is a force closure grasp if and only if we can exert, through the set of contacts, arbitrary force and moment on this object. Equivalently, any motion of the object is resisted by a contact force, that is the object cannot break contact with the finger tips without some non-zero external work. The force closure constraint is addressed from three different points of view: mathematics, physics, and computational geometry. The last formulation results in fast and simple polynomial time algorithms for directly constructing force closure grasps. We can also find grasps where each finger has an independent region of contact on the set of edges.},

  abstract = { The throughput of a manipulation process depends upon the arm's speed of operation, but many existing controllers provide accurate trajectory control only at low or moderate velocities. We propose a control method that explicitly compensates for configurationâdependent gravity, acceleration, and velocity forces â the latter being especially important during rapid simultaneous motions of a number of joints. A tabular form of the equations of motion is used in realâtime in conjunction with a configuration space memory organized by positional variables. The contents of the memory are preâcomputed only once for each manipulator and are usable for all possible movements. A planned implementation of this method for the Stanford Schienman arm that uses about 250K memory locations and requires about n3 + 3n2 arithmetic operations per evaluation is discussed, where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the device. },

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to design fixtures for complex objects in robotized environments. The object is described with a set of points on its surface. First, an initial form-closure fixture is found with an iterative algorithm. The initial fixture is then improved with an iterative approach relying on a geometrical reasoning that efficiently looks for a locally optimum fixture; the quality of the fixture is measured considering the largest perturbation wrench that the fixture can resist, with independence of its direction. Once a locally optimum fixture has been reached, independent contact regions are computed to provide robustness in front of the locator positioning errors or to allow variations in the locators position. The proposed approach can also be applied to compute fixtures when one or several locators are fixed beforehand. The procedure has been implemented and application examples are included in the paper.},

  abstract = { In this paper we consider grasps and fixtures whose contacts react according to forceâdisplacement laws consistent with friction constraints at the contacts. The passive force closure set of such grasps and fixtures is the set of external wrenches (forces and torques) that can act on the grasped object and be stably balanced by the contacts. An external wrench belongs to this set if it induces a feasible equilibrium whose basin of attraction contains the initial unperturbed grasp configuration. The paper focuses on planar grasps and fixtures having sharp-tipped fingers or fixels that satisfy linear force displacement laws. Using Morse theory, we characterize the number and stability type of k-contact equilibria induced by a given external wrench. Based on this analysis, we provide closed-form expressions for the passive force closure set of k-contact grasps and fixtures. Computation of the allowed external wrenches is illustrated with examples. Finally, the paper describes experiments verifying the passive force closure set on a spring-loaded grasping system. },

  abstract  = {Industrial robotic arms utilize multiple end-effectors, each for a specific part and for a specific task. We propose a novel algorithm which will define a single end-effectorâs configuration able to grasp a given set of objects with different geometries. The algorithm will have great benefit in production lines allowing a single robot to grasp various parts. Hence, reducing the number of endeffectors needed. Moreover, the algorithm will reduce end-effector design and manufacturing time and final product cost. The algorithm searches for a common grasp over the set of objects. The search algorithm maps all possible grasps for each object which satisfy a quality criterion and takes into account possible external wrenches (forces and torques) applied to the object. The mapped grasps are- represented by high-dimensional feature vectors which describes the shape of the gripper. We generate a database of all possible grasps for each object in the feature space. Then we use a search and
classification algorithm for intersecting all possible grasps over all
parts and finding a single common grasp suitable for all objects.
We present simulations of planar and spatial objects to validate the
feasibility of the approach.

  abstract = {A simple gripper for a robotic arm capable of grasping various objects in manufacturing lines provides great benefits in terms of standardization of grippers, reducing engineering time and costs. This will provide the possibility to reuse the manufacturing line for several products of different geometry without significant changes. The goal is to make a gripper such that it will be a commodity similar to the robot arms. The algorithm, termed 3D-OCOG (3-Dimensional Objects COmmon Grasp search) and proposed in this paper, searches for a common grasp configuration over a set of spatial objects. It maps all possible grasps for each object that satisfy force closure and quality criteria so the grasps could counter-balance external wrenches (forces and torque) applied to the object. The mapped grasps are parameterized as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space. This feature vector describes the design of the gripper. A database of feature vectors is generated for all possible grasps for each object in the feature space. A similarity join based on nearest-neighbor search and classification algorithm are used for intersecting all possible feature vectors over all objects and finding common ones. Each feature vector found is a grasp configuration for the group of objects, which directly implies the gripper design. Simulations of a 3-finger grasp of four meshed objects resulted in several common grasp solutions. Therefore, a designated experimental setup was established composed of three robotic fingers, to simulate the grasp of the test objects. Results of the simulations and experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},
