  abstract = { This paper studies the use of pushing actions to orient and trans late objects in the plane. The authors use linear normal pushes, which are straight-line pushes in a direction normal to the pushing fence. These pushes are specified by the fence orientation and push distance. The authors show that a set of linear normal pushes can always be found to move any polygonal object from any initial con figuration to any goal configuration in the obstacle-free plane. The object configuration is specified by its pose; that is, its position and orientation. The authors formulate the search for such a sequence of pushes as a linear programming problem. They then describe an implemented pose planner that uses this formulation to identify a sequence of linear normal pushes given any polygonal object, any initial pose, and any goal pose. This planner is proven to be com plete and to have polynomial time complexity. The planner, which uses an analysis of the mechanics of pushing an object, generates open-loop plans that do not require sensing. The authors describe experiments that demonstrate the validity of the generated plans. },

  abstract = {A new approach to the planning of form closure grasps by robotic hands is presented. The form closure grasp is to constrain a rigid workpiece by surrounding the object surface with mechanical fingers so that the object motion is geometrically constrained in all directions. First, kinematic conditions for the form closure grasp are obtained for workpieces with smooth surfaces, and are extended those one comprising edges and vertices. An efficient algorithm for examining the form closure grasp conditions is then developed by applying linear programming techniques. A computer-assisted planning system is also developed for the synthesis of grasping points as well as for the design of grippers. Fingertip locations are determined so as to accomplish the form closure grasp, given the geometry of a workpiece. A couple of examples demonstrate the usefulness of the method.},

  abstract = {In many assembly tasks it is necessary to ensure the stability of a subcollection of contacting objects. To achieve stability, it is often necessary to introduce fixture elements (also called ``fingers'' in some work) to help hold objects in place. In this paper the complexity of stabilizing multiple contacting bodies with the fewest number of fixture elements possible is considered. Standard fixture elements of the type explored in previous single-object grasping work are considered, along with a generalized variant of fixture elements. Both form-closure (complete immobility of the assembly), and first-order stability (stability of an assembly in the neighborhood of a specific external force and torque on each body) are considered. The major result is that for three of the four combinations of fixture element varieties and stability considered, achieving an optimal solution (that is, finding a smallest set of fixture elements yielding stability) is NP-hard. However, for many fixturing problems it seems likely that suboptimal, yet acceptably small solutions can be found in polynomial time, and some candidate algorithms are presented.},

  abstract = { The form-closure and force-closure properties of robotic grasp ing are investigated. Loosely speaking, these properties are related to the capability of the robot to inhibit motions of the workpiece in spite of externally applied forces. In this article, form-closure is considered as a purely geometric property of a set of unilateral (contact) constraints, such as those applied on a workpiece by a mechanical fixture, while force-closure is related to the capability of the particular robotic device being considered to apply forces through contacts. The concepts of partial form- and force-closure properties are introduced and discussed, and an algorithm is proposed to obtain a synthetic geometric description of partial form-closure constraints. Al though the literature abounds with form-closure tests, proposed algorithms for testing force-closure are either approximate or computationally expensive. This article proves the equiva lence of force-closure analysis with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary differential equation, to which Lyapunov's di rect method is applied. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm for assessing the force-closure property of the grasp. },

We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable. We present statistical data that confirm our opinion that a randomized grasp generation algorithm is fast and suitable for the planning of robot grasping tasks.},

The algorithm has been implemented, and physical experiments have been performed to test the validity of the algorithm's predictions.

  abstract  = {Commercially-available modular fixturing systems typically include a square lattice of tapped and bushed holes with precise spacing and an assortment of precision locating and clamping elements that can be rigidly attached to the lattice using dowel pins or expanding mandrels. Currently, human expertise is required to synthesize a suitable arrangement of these elements to hold a given part. Besides being time consuming, if the set of alternatives is not systematically explored, the designer may fail to find an acceptable fixture or may settle upon a suboptimal fixture. The authors consider a class of modular fixtures that prevent a part from translating or rotating in the plane using four point contacts on the part's boundary. These fixtures are based on three round locators, each centered on a lattice point, and one translating clamp. The authors present an algorithm that accepts a polygonal part shape as input and synthesizes the set of all fixture designs that achieve form closure for the given part. The algorithm also allows the user to specify geometric access constraints on fixtures. If the part has n edges and its maximal diameter is d lattice units, the asymptotic running time of the algorithm is O(n/sup 5/d/sup 5/). The authors have implemented the algorithm and present example fixtures that it has synthesized. This implementation includes a metric to rank fixtures based on their ability to resist applied forces. The authors believe this is the first fixture synthesis algorithm that is complete in the sense that it is guaranteed to find an admissible fixture if one exists. Furthermore, the algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal fixture, relative to any well-defined quality metric.<<ETX>>},

Each fixture is composed of three locators rigidly attached to the lattice and one sliding clamp, and constrains the part without relying on friction. The algorithm is based on an efficient enumeration of admissible designs that exploits part geometry and graphical force analysis. The algorithm run time is linear in the number of designs found, which is bounded by a polynomial in the number of part edges and the part's maximal diameter in lattice units. Our review of the literature suggests that this is the first fixturing algorithm that is complete in the sense that it is guaranteed to find all admissible fixture designs for an arbitrary polygonal silhouette and to identify the optimal fixture relative to an arbitrary quality metric. The algorithm does not consider out-of-plane forces or motions; however, we view this planar result as an essential component of a larger algorithm that solves the 3D fixture design problem by treating the planar and out-of-plane constraint problems separately. This approach is analogous to the widely used 3-2-1 fixture design heuristic},

The arm brings the part near the chuck. The wrist positions the part, giving it the proper orientation to slide in. After the part is inserted, the wrist and fingers make tiny corrections to ensure that it is correctly seated. Today's robot attempting the same operations is at a grave disadvantage if it has to make all motions with the arm. The following work investigates the use of robotic wrists and hands to help industrial robots perform the fine motions needed in a metal working cell. Chapters 1 and 2 are an introduction to the field and a review of previous investigations on related subjects. Little work has been done on grasping and fine manipulation with a robot hand or wrist, but the related subjects of robot arm dynamics and control have an extensive literature.},

  abstract  = {Grasping objects in confined environments, such as shelves, fridges, or drawers, is challenging due to the difficulty of avoiding gripper and arm collisions with the surfaces surrounding the object. In this paper we explore the use of a tool to reconfigure objects in such environments so as to make them graspable. The proposed tool has a simple form that allows it to be used in confined environments and a high friction tool tip that enables not only pushing objects but also pulling them. Our approach involves learning predictive models of pre-defined object-directed tool actions from experience. For each action, we train a multi-modal regressor that maps the initial state of an object to changes in that state, such that future states of the object can be estimated. These allow the robot to choose a sequence of tool actions that yield graspable configurations. We demonstrate that our approach enables a PR2 robot to grasp five different objects from different, initially ungraspable, configurations on a shelf.},

Given two points, p and q, we investigate the bisector, B(p,q), of p and q, where distance from p is measured by ?C and distance from q by ?D. We provide the following results. B(p,q) may consist of many connected components whose precise number can be derived from the intersection of the unit balls, C and D. The bisector can contain bounded or unbounded two-dimensional areas. Even more surprising, pieces of the bisector may appear inside the region of all points closer to p than to q. If C and D are convex polygons over m and n vertices, respectively, the bisector B(p,q) can consist of at most min(m,n) connected components which contain at most 2(m+n) vertices altogether. The former bound is tight, the latter is tight up to an additive constant. We also present an optimal O(m+n) time algorithm for computing the bisector.},

The object is small-time locally controllable by stable pushing if, by switching among pushing edges, it can be pushed to follow any path arbitrarily closely. Since the pushes are stable by the frictional mechanics, pushing plans can be executed without position feedback of the object. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a polygon to be small-time locally controllable by stable pushing: the pushing friction coefficient must be nonzero and the set of feasible pure forces (forces applied through a polygon edge and passing through the center of friction) must positively span the plane. We interpret this condition in terms of the polygon shape, the location of the center of friction, and the pushing friction coefficient, allowing us to characterize classes of polygons with this fundamental “manoeuvrability” property},

Unfortunately, the motion of a pushed object is generally unpredictable due to unknown support friction forces. With multiple pushing contact points, however, it is possible to find pushing directions that cause the object to remain fixed to the manipulator. These are called stable pushing directions. In this article we consider the problem of planning pushing paths using stable pushes. Pushing imposes a set of nonholonomic velocity constraints on the motion of the object, and we study the issues of local and global controllability during pushing with point contact or stable line contact. We describe a planner for finding stable pushing paths among obstacles, and the planner is demon strated on several manipulation tasks. },

A method is presented for finding an orientation of the assembly so that the assembly remains motionless under gravity. If no stable orientation exists for an assembly, the method finds the "least" unstable orientation. The metric used to measure stability is based on the second time-rate of change of the gravitational potential energy, and the desired orientation for an assembly is expressed in terms of an optimization problem involving changes in potential energy. The problem of finding stable or maximally-stable orientations is formulated as a constrained maximin problem. The maximin problem is shown to be a variant of standard zero-sum matrix games, and can be solved using linear programming. The method is the first general method for automatically determining stable orientations. Example assemblies are presented.<<ETX>>},

  abstract  = {We study the criteria under which an object can be gripped by a multifingered dexterous hand, assuming no static friction between the object and the fingers; such grips are called positive grips. We study three cases in detail: (i) the body is at equilibrium, (ii) the body is under some constant external force/torque, and (iii) the body is under a varying external force/torque. In each case we obtain tight bounds on the number of fingers needed to obtain grip. We also present efficient algorithms to synthesize such positive grips for bounded polyhedral/polygonal objects; the number of fingers employed in the grips synthesized by our algorithms match the above bounds. The algorithms run in time linear in the number of faces/sides. The paper may be of independent interest for its presentation of algorithms arising in the study of positive linear spaces.},

The main issue has been how to control mechanical hands so that they can perform manipulation task with the same dexterity and sensitivity as the human hands. To achieve sophisticated algorithms for grasping, compliance control, and manipulation, the nature of the contact wrenches, twists, and compliance of the fingers have to be well understood. Here emphasis is on the area of dextrous manipulation encompassed by static grasping. The two main approaches to the problems of grasping reviewed are those motivated by a study of human hands and those motivated by the physical and mechanical properties of grasps such as contact types, number of fingers required to achieve grasp, equilibrium, stability and compliance},

  abstract = { The kinematics of contact describe the motion of a point of contact over the surfaces of two contacting objects in response to a relative motion of these objects. Using concepts from differential geometry, I derive a set of equations, called the contact equations, that embody this relationship. I employ the contact equations to design the following applications to be executed by an end-effector with tactile sensing capability: ( 1) determining the curvature form of an unknown object at a point of contact; and (2) following the surface of an unknown object. The contact equations also serve as a basis for an investigation of the kinematics of grasp. I derive the relation ship between the relative motion of two fingers grasping an object and the motion of the points of contact over the object surface. Based on this analysis, we explore the following applications: (1) rolling a sphere between two arbitrarily shaped fingers ; (2) fine grip adjustment ( i.e., having two fingers that grasp an unknown object locally optimize their grip for maximum stability). },

A grasp on an object is a force closure grasp if and only if we can exert, through the set of contacts, arbitrary force and moment on this object. Equivalently, any motion of the object is resisted by a contact force, that is the object cannot break contact with the finger tips without some non-zero external work. The force closure constraint is addressed from three different points of view: mathematics, physics, and computational geometry. The last formulation results in fast and simple polynomial time algorithms for directly constructing force closure grasps. We can also find grasps where each finger has an independent region of contact on the set of edges.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates manipulation of multiple unknown objects in a crowded environment. Because of incomplete knowledge due to unknown objects and occlusions in visual observations, object observations are imperfect and action success is uncertain, making planning challenging. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which allows a general reward based optimization objective and takes uncertainty in temporal evolution and partial observations into account. In addition to occlusion dependent observation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also automatically adapts object specific action success probabilities. To cope with the changing system dynamics and performance constraints, we present a new online POMDP method based on particle filtering that produces compact policies. The approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a scenario of moving dirty dishes into a dishwasher. The results indicate that: 1) a greedy heuristic manipulation approach is not sufficient, multi-object manipulation requires multi-step POMDP planning, and 2) on-line planning is beneficial since it allows the adaptation of the system dynamics model based on actual experience.},

We propose a control method that explicitly compensates for configuration?dependent gravity, acceleration, and velocity forces ? the latter being especially important during rapid simultaneous motions of a number of joints. A tabular form of the equations of motion is used in real?time in conjunction with a configuration space memory organized by positional variables. The contents of the memory are pre?computed only once for each manipulator and are usable for all possible movements. A planned implementation of this method for the Stanford Schienman arm that uses about 250K memory locations and requires about n3 + 3n2 arithmetic operations per evaluation is discussed, where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the device. },

The initial fixture is then improved with an iterative approach relying on a geometrical reasoning that efficiently looks for a locally optimum fixture; the quality of the fixture is measured considering the largest perturbation wrench that the fixture can resist, with independence of its direction. Once a locally optimum fixture has been reached, independent contact regions are computed to provide robustness in front of the locator positioning errors or to allow variations in the locators position. The proposed approach can also be applied to compute fixtures when one or several locators are fixed beforehand.

The passive force closure set of such grasps and fixtures is the set of external wrenches (forces and torques) that can act on the grasped object and be stably balanced by the contacts. An external wrench belongs to this set if it induces a feasible equilibrium whose basin of attraction contains the initial unperturbed grasp configuration. The paper focuses on planar grasps and fixtures having sharp-tipped fingers or fixels that satisfy linear force displacement laws. Using Morse theory, we characterize the number and stability type of k-contact equilibria induced by a given external wrench. Based on this analysis, we provide closed-form expressions for the passive force closure set of k-contact grasps and fixtures. Computation of the allowed external wrenches is illustrated with examples. Finally, the paper describes experiments verifying the passive force closure set on a spring-loaded grasping system. },

We propose a novel algorithm which will define a single end-effector’s configuration able to grasp a given set of objects with different geometries. The algorithm will have great benefit in production lines allowing a single robot to grasp various parts. Hence, reducing the number of endeffectors needed. Moreover, the algorithm will reduce end-effector design and manufacturing time and final product cost. The algorithm searches for a common grasp over the set of objects. The search algorithm maps all possible grasps for each object which satisfy a quality criterion and takes into account possible external wrenches (forces and torques) applied to the object. The mapped grasps are- represented by high-dimensional feature vectors which describes the shape of the gripper. We generate a database of all possible grasps for each object in the feature space. Then we use a search and
classification algorithm for intersecting all possible grasps over all
parts and finding a single common grasp suitable for all objects.
We present simulations of planar and spatial objects to validate the
feasibility of the approach.

This will provide the possibility to reuse the manufacturing line for several products of different geometry without significant changes. The goal is to make a gripper such that it will be a commodity similar to the robot arms. The algorithm, termed 3D-OCOG (3-Dimensional Objects COmmon Grasp search) and proposed in this paper, searches for a common grasp configuration over a set of spatial objects. It maps all possible grasps for each object that satisfy force closure and quality criteria so the grasps could counter-balance external wrenches (forces and torque) applied to the object. The mapped grasps are parameterized as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space. This feature vector describes the design of the gripper. A database of feature vectors is generated for all possible grasps for each object in the feature space. A similarity join based on nearest-neighbor search and classification algorithm are used for intersecting all possible feature vectors over all objects and finding common ones. Each feature vector found is a grasp configuration for the group of objects, which directly implies the gripper design. Simulations of a 3-finger grasp of four meshed objects resulted in several common grasp solutions. Therefore, a designated experimental setup was established composed of three robotic fingers, to simulate the grasp of the test objects. Results of the simulations and experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {An efficient quantitative test for form closure valid for any number of contact points is formulated as a linear program, the optimal objective value of which provides a measure of how far a grasp is from losing form closure. When the grasp does not have form closure, manipulation planning requires a means for predicting the object's stability and instantaneous velocity, given the joint velocities of the hand. The classical approach to computing these quantities is to solve the systems of kinematic inequalities corresponding to all possible combinations of separating or sliding at the contacts. All combinations resulting in the interpenetration of bodies or the infeasibility of the equilibrium equations are rejected. The remaining combination is consistent with all the constraints and is used to compute the velocity of the manipulated object and the contact forces, which indicate whether or not the object is stable. A linear program whose solution yields the same information as the classical approach, usually without explicit testing of all possible combinations of contact interactions, is formulated.<<ETX>>},

  abstract = { We study two- and three-finger caging grasps of a given polygonal object with n edges. A grasp is said to cage an object when it is impossible to take the object to a distant location without penetrating a finger. Using a classification into squeezing and stretching cagings, we provide an algorithm that reports all caging grasps of two disk fingers in O (n2 log n) time. Our result extends and improves a recent solution for point fingers (Pipattanasomporn and Sudsang 2006). In addition, we construct a data structure in O (n2 log n) time requiring O (n2) space that can be queried in O (log n) time whether a given two-finger grasp cages the polygon. We also establish a relation between two-finger caging grasps and two-finger immobilizing grasps of polygons without parallel edges. We also study caging grasps with three point fingers. Given the placements of two so-called base fingers, the caging region is the set of all placements of the third finger that jointly with the base fingers forms a caging grasp of a polygonal object. Using the relation between equilibrium grasps and the boundary of the caging region, we present an algorithm that reports the entire caging region in O (n6 log2n) time. Our result extends a previous solution that only applies to convex polygons (Erickson et al. 2007). },

We define four types of task-specific preshape and two modes of digit closure, and give criteria for the choice and positioning of the pre-shapes, based on intersecting digit trajectories with the graspable surfaces of the object. Grasps are planned in simulation using real range data from a laser striper and an anthropomorphic hand model. Our results show that a range of polyhedral and curved objects can be grasped using relatively simple, fast algorithms when the hand movements are constrained in this way},

The concepts of the Instantaneous Rotational Center (IRC) Triangular are illustrated at the first. The representational and the judgmental methods for fourfinger grasping in form closure are studied based on the definitions of IRC triangular, and the identification method of existence for given four edges of the polygonal objects with feasible grasped position by four fingers in form closure is established. The geometric position and position relationships among fingers on grasped polygon in form closure can be expressed by geometric equation. The proposed planning method for form closure grasping by using the IRC triangle is not only geometric distinct but also complete and general. The method also can be extended future so that it is capable of dealing with the object whose profile includes circular edges.},

  abstract = { A new theory in contact mechanics for modeling of soft fingers is proposed to define the relationship between the normal force and the radius of contact for soft fingers by considering general soft-finger materials, including linearly and nonlinearly elastic materials. The results show that the radius of contact is proportional to the normal force raised to the power of, which ranges from 0 to 1/3. This new theory subsumes the Hertzian contact model for linear elastic materials, where D 1/3. Experiments are conducted to validate the theory using artificial soft fingers made of various materials such as rubber and silicone. Results for human fingers are also compared. This theory provides a basis for numerically constructing friction limit surfaces. The numerical friction limit surface can be approximated by an ellipse, with the major and minor axes as the maximum friction force and the maximum moment with respect to the normal axis of contact, respectively. Combining the results of the contactmechanics model with the contact-pressure distribution, the normalized friction limit surface can be derived for anthropomorphic soft fingers. The results of the contact-mechanics model and the pressure distribution for soft fingers facilitate the construction of numerical friction limit surfaces, and will enable us to analyze and simulate contact behaviors of grasping and manipulation in robotics. },
